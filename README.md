# CS 216: Final Project

COVID has made a significant impact on our world over the course of the past few years - but for many countries, that is not the leading cause of death. Whether it’s through viral
diseases such as COVID or deaths caused by heart disease, cancer, violence, and suicide, our
team was interested in studying general trends between a country’s standing in the world and the
reason their citizens are dying. Furthermore, we would like to explore if there is a way to identify
key factors that influence a country’s total deaths as well as COVID-19 deaths.

Our research questions are:
- How do different types of economic, sociological, and demographical data correlate with
various causes of death?
- What factors identify a country’s total deaths?
- Can we identify the best indicators for deaths due to COVID-19?

Our motivation behind these research questions ultimately stems from wanting to
understand how mortality rates of countries correlate with different factors. Ultimately, we want
to discover ways to lower mortality rates by identifying these factors. Then, we can use these
results to see what factors should be focused on by a country and allot more resources.
